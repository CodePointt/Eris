# Eris
Eris is a developing discord bot with powerful moderation tools and other (under developement) features such as rate. 
Programmed by @waclyu#5448, the current Eris code (written in C#) is the third iteration of Eris's code and the sixth iteration of the original bot, SystemBot. 
the goal is for Eris to become a popular moderation bot, with more preset capabilities than Mee6 and YAGPDB.
